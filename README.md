# üå§Ô∏è nano 33 ble sense weather predictor

A simple weather prediction project using the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Lite** and a **DHT11** sensor.  
It collects real-time **temperature, humidity, and pressure** data for a **hour** and predicts **next hours** upcoming values using a trained model.

---

## üß† Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Collect live sensor data via Arduino.
- Send it to a Python script for CSV logging.
- Train a lightweight model to predict short-term weather changes.

If you‚Äôre using the **regular Nano 33 BLE** (non-Lite), you can skip the external humidity sensor ‚Äî  
it already includes a built-in one.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Lite** | Core MCU | Used for data collection |
| **DHT11 Sensor** | Humidity & temperature | Replace with DHT22 / BME280 for higher accuracy |
| **Barometric Pressure Sensor (optional)** | Pressure readings | Any I¬≤C sensor like BMP280 works |

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The Lite version doesn‚Äôt have a humidity sensor bult-in,use DHT11 or better.
It is important to use good sensor for any actual use

remember to put nano 33 to programming mode before uploading

## üíª Software Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `requirements.txt` | Python libraries required for the project. |
| `install_req.bat` | Batch file to install the Python libraries. |
| `collectdata.py` | Reads data from Arduino Nano and saves to `data.csv` (no Arduino IDE needed). |
| `weather_collect.ino` | Arduino sketch to collect training data. |
| `data.csv` | Logged data file created automatically by `collectdata.py`. |
| `data-Copy.csv` *(optional)* | Backup copy of `data.csv`. Only one app can use `data.csv` at a time. |
| `trainmodel.py` | Script to train and test the prediction model. |
| `model_test.ino` | Arduino sketch to test the trained model before deployment. |
| `weather_predict.ino` | Arduino sketch to predict sensor values using the trained model. |

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Arduino collects pressure, temperature, and humidity samples. Data is logged via Python.  

2. **Preprocessing**:  
   - Min-Max normalization  
   - Sliding windows of 12 samples (`window_size`)  
   - Predicting deltas for next 12 samples (`pred_size`)  

3. **Model**:  
   - Dense neural network with 2 hidden layers (64 neurons each, ReLU activation)  
   - Weighted MSE loss to emphasize temperature prediction  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Model predicts deltas, converts them to absolute values using the last reading, and denormalizes using the `MinMaxScaler`.  

5. **Arduino Deployment**:  
   - Model converted to `.tflite` ‚Üí `.h`  
   - Loaded in Arduino for real-time predictions

## How to Use

1. **Install all required libraries** for both Python and Arduino IDE.

2. **Upload** `weather_collect.ino` to your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

3. **Run** `collectdata.py` (ensure the Serial Monitor is closed).  
   Repeat twice if it does not work the first time.

4. **Collect data** for at least 3‚Äì4 days.  
   For long-term prediction, extend data collection to 1‚Äì2 weeks per season.

5. **Run** `trainmodel.py` to train and test the model.

6. **Copy the min and max values** from the Python scaler and use them in the Arduino sketch  
   to scale sensor data in the same range as used for training.
   
8. **Place** the `weather_model.h` file and the min/max arrays into the Arduino project folder you want to use.

   **It‚Äôs best to export the compiled binary** (Sketch ‚Üí Export Compiled Binary)  
   **so it doesn't compile every time. Note: compilation may take some time.**

9. **(Optional)** Test the model with model_test.ino in a controlled environment and verify your preprocessing steps.

10. **Upload** `weather_predict.ino` to your Arduino for real-time predictions.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Arduino IDE**  
- Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow

## Notes

- Only one application should use `data.csv` at a time; use `data-Copy.csv` as backup if needed.  
- Weighted MSE loss emphasizes temperature prediction accuracy.  
- RMSE for each feature is printed after training.
